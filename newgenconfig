# The new genconfig script works by copying all base system options from the master
# config and then using the builtin menuconfig Makefiles to setup all dependencies. 
# This means that in order to get a package built only one specific system and not for the 
# others, you need to make sure that the package is not already selected in the master config
# Any other packages that you want to select for a specific model/customer you should set
# in the model and customer makefiles as package dependencies to the given model/customer package
